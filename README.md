# Hexathon 2023
Repository of team TBD's entry to the Hexathon 2023 24-hour hackathon by Hexagon

# Description
A system that maps out an optimal route for the collection of garbage from dustbins depending on how full they are. These "dustbins" are simply collection points for garbage, and are connected over a mesh network and send the amount of garbage they contain. Each collection run, an optimal route will be planned.
